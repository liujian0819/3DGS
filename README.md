## C-SAGS: A Unified Framework for Text-Driven 2D-3D Segmentation using Informed 3D Gaussian Splatting

In computer vision, 3D segmentation is crucial for scene understanding. This study introduces C-SAGS, a comprehensive framework integrating CLIP, SAM, and 3DGS models for zero-shot, cross-modal 3D segmentation using text and geometric prompts. C-SAGS leverages informed 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D scene representation, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance and reduced storage requirements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our framework supports individual manipulation of segmented objects, facilitating 3D scene editing and reconstruction. We demonstrate a significant enhancement in IoU and accuracy, positioning our work within a broader context of 3D scene comprehension.
